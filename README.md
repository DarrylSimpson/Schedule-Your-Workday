* WHEN you view the blocks for that day
* THEN the blocks will be color-coded to indicate whether it is past, present, or future
* WHEN you click into a time black
* THEN you can eneter an event
* WHEN you click save for a time block
* THEN the text will be saved in local storage
* WHEN you refresh the page
* THEN the save event will persist
